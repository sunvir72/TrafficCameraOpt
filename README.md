<!-- # ECE650 : Assignment 3

Replace FIRST_NAME, LAST_NAME, WATIAM, and STUDENT_ID, EMAIL in
`user.yml` by your first and last name, WatIAM id, student number, and
email, respectively. Whenever possible, please use ASCII characters.

Do not change the format `user.yml`. We will parse it
automatically. Only enter the information requested.

The main file for your solution to the assignment should be
`ece650-a3.cpp`. You can use `test.cpp` for your unit tests.

You might need to modify `CMakeLists.txt` if you are adding additional
source files for your code and/or tests.

Commit your changes and submit on GitLab.

Traffic Intersection Camera Optimization

◦ Solved the problem of installing minimum possible cameras at intersection of streets using Python and C++.

◦ Used Multithreading and Inter Processor Communication (IPC) to efficiently distribute work among different
process and facilitate communication.

◦ Implemented an approximate algorithm for the Vertex Cover problem to find vertex for installation of security
cameras at traffic intersections.

◦ Computed the approximation ratio between the MiniSAT solver and the approximation algorithms and presented a
comparative study documenting the trade-offs in running time and accuracy
